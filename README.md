# StockStream-Real-Time-Data-Pipeline

## Introduction 
This project is an End-To-End Data Engineering Project on Real-Time Stock Market Data using Kafka.

I used different technologies such as Python, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Apache Kafka, Glue, Athena, and SQL.

## Technology Used
- Programming Language - Python
- Amazon Web Service (AWS)
1. S3 (Simple Storage Service)
2. Athena
3. Glue Crawler
4. Glue Catalog
5. EC2
- Apache Kafka


## Summary
• Engineered an end-to-end data pipeline using Apache Kafka, Python, and AWS services (EC2, S3, Glue, and Athena) to process and
analyze real-time stock market data.
• Implemented AWS Glue Crawler to automatically catalog data stored in S3 and used Athena to perform SQL queries, enabling
efficient data retrieval and analysis.
• Utilized Apache Kafka, hosted on AWS EC2 instances, as the central message broker to facilitate the seamless flow of real-time data
between producers and consumers low latency in data processing.
